## Pixiv Image Organizer

This app automatically organises images from Pixiv by identifying the franchise tags associated with each illustration. Based on the tags retrieved via the Pixivpy, the program sorts images into appropriate folders by franchise (e.g., Hololive, Genshin Impact, etc.).

# Current Features:

- Retrieves image tags using the Pixivpy.
- Sorts images into franchise-specific folders based on the tags.
- Handles multiple franchises and prioritizes based on predefined franchise categories.

# Future Improvements:

- <p>Artist Sorting: <br>In future updates, I plan to implement functionality to organize images by the artist as well, creating dedicated folders for each artist in addition to sorting by franchise.</p>
